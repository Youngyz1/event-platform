/**
 * Shared helpers for tagging/parsing NOWPayments `order_id` values with an
 * explicit kind, so `/api/crypto/webhook` can dispatch to exactly one table
 * instead of blindly probing donations → ticket_orders → businesses in
 * sequence. NOWPayments treats `order_id` as an opaque merchant string and
 * echoes it back verbatim in the IPN callback, so the kind tag survives the
 * round trip with no NOWPayments-side configuration needed.
 *
 * Every crypto checkout-initiation route (create-payment, business-crypto,
 * and future products-crypto) must tag its `order_id` with `tagCryptoOrderId`
 * before sending it to NOWPayments. The webhook is the only place that calls
 * `parseCryptoOrderId`.
